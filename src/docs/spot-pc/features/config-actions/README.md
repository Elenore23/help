The Idle to Disconnect session security setting controls how many minutes a user's session can sit idle before being their connection is closed.  When the connection is closed, the user’s session and open applications are unaffected.  When reconnecting to their desktop, the user will be routed to the existing session and they can resume work where they left off.

The Disconnect to Logoff session security setting controls how many minutes a user's session can continue to run once their connection is closed. When the user’s session is logged off, the user’s open applications are closed and the session is ended.  When reconnecting to their desktop, a new user session will be created on the appropriate host based on performance and load balancing rules.
